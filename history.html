                <p>Many timeless brands are timeless because they keep the logos that people know and trust. Pepsi is a brilliant exception. The history of the Pepsi logo is one of constant reimagination. Over its 122 years history, the logo has seen 12 redesigns. And that's not even counting the smaller changes for flavor variations like, Diet Pepsi and Pepsi Max.</p>

              <p>Before Pepsi was Pepsi, it was known as Brad's Drink, created by Pharmacists Caled Bradham in New Bern, North Carolina in 1893. During that same Era, Pharmacists created a bunch of sodas we know and love today.</p>

              <h2>RED & SWIRLY <br> 1898-1940</h2>
              <p>In 1898, Brad's drink became known as Pepsi Cola, a named derived from the word"dyspepsia," another word for indigestion. (Remeber, these were the days when soft drinks were considered medicinal aids</p>

              <h2>EYE-CATCHING RED COLA <br> 1905</h2>
              <p>When Brad's drink became Pepsi-Cola, the logos main color changed to an eye-catching red. The Serif's and mid hieght letter  spikes that dcorated the original front became longer, fang-like spikes protruding from the tops and bottoms of the letters and the final "A" stretched out and coiled upward like a trail.</p>

              <h2>DRINK SPIKEY SERIF <br> 1906</h2>
              <p>Then just a year later, the logo change again. It was still red, it was still weavy, and it is still looked a lot like certain other cola brand's logo (more on that in a minute). The 1906 iteration of the Pepsi Cola logo made the letters thicker again and condensed the wordmark, making the letters P and C just a bit taller than the rest of the letters.  </p>

              <p>The 1940 logo like the earlier pepsi-Cola logos', was done through classic lettering. The 1940 version of Pepsi-Cola's logo is characterized by the Serif's on the wordmarks smaller letters shrinking again, becoming almost invisible in the workmarks larger letters becoming taller and wider. Over all, the text thinned out, giving the logo a less condensed look.</p>

              <p>In the 1950s, Pepsi-Cola continued branding themselves as the Soda that delivers the better value. More bounce to the ounce, was the tagline of the day, which promised more thsn just more soda per bottle than Coca-Cola. It promised for a more fun.</p>

              <p>In addition to ditching the word "Cola", Pepsi ditched the swoopy. Swirley red font they'd been using for the past 64 years. Now, pepsi told the world who they were with a bold, san's serif, stamp-like black wordmark across the bottle cap.  </p>

              <h2>FROM BOTTLE CAP TO GLOBE <br> 1973</h2>
              <p>Pepsi embraced 1970s minimalism when they switched to the globe logo in 1973. This was a fairly simple chamge; the bottle cap just dropped its bridges</p>

              <h2>THE COLA WARS RAGE ON <br> 1987</h2>
              <p>In 1987, Pepsi gave the globe logo a little facelit. And although the facelit looks relatively minor, there is actually one huge change (and a few less-huge changes) that occured with this update.</p>

              <h2>THE BREAK UP <br> 1991</h2>
              <p>In 1991, Pepsi changed their logo in a dramatic way again.They kept the wordmark, they keep the globe, but for the first time ever, they were separated. The globe made its way to the bottom right of the logo while the wod "Pepsi", now italicized, stretched across the top of the logo in blue. In the ngative space beneath the the text and beside the beneath the globe, we see a red bar reminiscent of the red banner on earlier versions of the logo.</p>

              <p>In 2003, pepsi's new logo got a but of a tweak. The globe was redesigned to have large, conspicious white "shine" spots that made it look like it'd been vacuum-sealed in plastic, giving the logo a flatter look.</p>
